To run the application the following steps are to be followed : 


-- download all the files from my repo
-- install xampp server (if you don't have) otherwise open xampp server 
-- create database with name contact_form and then click on the import button then select the contact_form.sql file (downloaded from my repo)
-- then open the xampp directory goto the htdocs folder and paste the assignment directory to htdocs folder
-- then open the browser and hit the localhost/assignment/ 

Note :-- As this application  is not live on the server (as it is on only local server) , so the mail will not be sent to the owner . But if the same code is opened on the liveserver then the mail will be sent .
-- all mail() method is used. so the mail sent to the spam folder . 
-- We can use php mailer instead of mail() method for better performance
